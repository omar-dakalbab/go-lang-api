This file provides a basic overview of the `main.go` code for a book inventory API.

**Dependencies:**

* gin: [https://github.com/gin-gonic](https://github.com/gin-gonic)
* uuid: [https://github.com/topics/uuid](https://github.com/topics/uuid)

**Data Model:**

The API uses a `book` struct to represent a book in the inventory.

```go
type book struct {
  ID string `json:"id"`
  Title string `json:"title"`
  Author string `json:"author"`
  Quantity int `json:"quantity"`
}
```

**Global Books List:**

A global variable `books` is used to store a slice of `book` structs representing the current inventory.

```go
var books = []book{
  // ... book data
}
```

**API Endpoints:**

* **GET /books:** Retrieves all books in the inventory.
* **GET /books/:id:** Retrieves a specific book by its ID.
* **POST /books:** Creates a new book in the inventory.
* **PUT /books/:id/checkin:** Increases the quantity of a specific book by 1.
* **PUT /books/:id/checkout:** Decreases the quantity of a specific book by 1 (if available).

**Error Handling:**

The API returns appropriate HTTP status codes and error messages for various scenarios, such as book not found, bad request, and out-of-stock books.

**Running the Server:**

The `main` function starts a Gin server on port 8080.

**Note:**

This is a basic example and might not include functionalities like user authentication or data persistence.
